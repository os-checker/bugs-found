  = note: Undefined Behavior occurred here
  = note: (no span available)
  = help: this indicates a bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, and caused Undefined Behavior
  = help: see https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html for further information
  = help: this means these two types are not *guaranteed* to be ABI-compatible across all targets
  = help: if you think this code should be accepted anyway, please report an issue with Miri
